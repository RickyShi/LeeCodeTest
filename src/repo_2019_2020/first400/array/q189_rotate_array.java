    /**
     * Need to be revisited
     * Approach #3 Using Cyclic Replacements [Accepted]
     * Assume k = k % n.
     * <p>
     * Imagine we have an array A = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (n = 7) and need to shift it right by k = 3 by HAND.
     * <p>
     * What I would do is start from index 0, hold A[0]=0 in hand, go to next index (0 + k) % n = (0 + 3) % 7 = 3, and swap A[3] with what I hold in hand, repeat this step until all elements are moved. The indexes of elements traversed form a closed chain 0 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 0, which has 7 elements, equal to array length.
     * <p>
     * However, if n and k are not mutually prime, we may return to start position before moving all elements, forming a closed chain with elements fewer than n, e.g. n = 6, k = 4 => 0 -> 4 -> 2 -> 0, this chain only has L1 = 3 elements. To move all elements, we need to start from index 1 and traverse another chain 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1, which contains L2 = 3 different elements. In total we moved L1 + L2 = 3 + 3 = 6 == n elements, and each element moved only once.
     * <p>
     * The general procedures are:
     * <p>
     * start from index start = 0 (actually can be any other index)
     * cyclically shift element at index (start + m * k) right by k until reaching start again, forming a closed chain
     * shift start by 1, repeat step 1 and 2 until all elements moved.

     * Approach #4 Using Reverse [Accepted]
     * Algorithm
     *
     * This approach is based on the fact that when we rotate the array k times, k%nk elements from the back end of the array come to the front and the rest of the elements from the front shift backwards.
     *
     * In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array. Then, reversing the first k elements followed by reversing the rest n-knâˆ’k elements gives us the required result.
     *
     * Let n=7 and k=3.
     *
     * Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
     * After reversing all numbers     : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
     * After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1
     * After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 --> Result
